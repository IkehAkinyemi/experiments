### Quick intro🛣
This repository🌿 contains 💥experimental💥 code snippets that I want to have, but don't deserve their own repository🌿.

It's a collection of little snippets of programs I've tinker with when I test out 💡flickering-bulb ideas💡, meaning some are written✍🏾 quickly and off the cuff.

Some of these are mostly snippets of snippets from articles, tutorial, small projects, 💥experimental thoughts and some courses. This is also a safe space to shamelessly 😎 place keep those "Hello World"👋🏾👋🏾 and basic examples.

This kind of rough idea💡 help me build more on them to form a working🧑‍🏭 sample that I could possibly incude in a 📽project/production📽. They're not complete.

### Structure🌿
I've organized🧠 the snippets by language🤟🏾, library📚 or 🖼framework, each having its own directories. The title of each file should give a half baked clue🤔 about its context. Please note⚠️⚠️, however, that some of these are written quickly and aren't necessarily well documented. They're in professional terms "prototype" or "experimental" code.🤲🏾🤲🏾

### Disclaimer⛔️⛔️
I make no guarantee of any of these code samples functioning or serving any specific need. I do try to mark code that doesn't work, though. These programs are here primarily for 🧑🏾‍🏫educational🧑🏾‍🏫 or reference value🌈.

That being said, I do hope you find them useful. I'd love to hear from you if so📧.
