### Quick intro
This repository contains experimental code snippets that I want to have, but don't deserve their own repository.

It's a collection of little snippets of programs I've tinker with when I test out flickering-bulb ideas, meaning some are written quickly and off the cuff.

Some of these are mostly snippets of snippets from articles, tutorial, small projects, experimental thoughts and some courses. This is also a safe space to shamelessly  place keep those "Hello World" and basic examples.

This kind of rough ideaüí° help me build more on them to form a working sample that I could possibly incude in a üìΩproject/productionüìΩ. They're not complete.

### Structure
I've organized the snippets by language, library or framework, each having its own directories. The title of each file should give a half baked clue about its context. Please note‚ö†Ô∏è, however, that some of these are written quickly and aren't necessarily well documented. They're in professional terms "prototype" or "experimental" code.

### Disclaimer
I make no guarantee of any of these code samples functioning or serving any specific need. I do try to mark code that doesn't work, though. These programs are here primarily for educational or reference value.

That being said, I do hope you find them useful. I'd love to hear from you if so.
